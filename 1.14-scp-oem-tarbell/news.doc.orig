The documentation for this release of 86-DOS is not complete yet, we
have enclosed the documentation for version 1.0 and a few sheets
explaining new features which are necessary to know to use the system.
We hope to make a new addendum which will replace the 1.0 addendum and
all the loose sheet in a couple of weeks.  Microsoft has purchased
86-DOS from us and now owns all the rights to it including the
responsibility to document it.  When the final manuals from Microsoft
are available you will get copies.

The file CPMTAB.ASM is the source file for the tables used by RDCPM and
is provided as an example of how new tables may be prepared. These
tables allow reading 8" or 5" single-density CP/M disks. If new tables
are desired for reading disks of a different CP/M 2 format, follow 
these steps:

	1. Prepare a source file of the new tables (see MAKRDCPM in
	   manual).

	2. Assemble the new tables.

	3. Convert the new tables to binary with HEX2BIN.

	4. Run MAKRDCPM.


The files INIT.ASM and INIT.COM are the source and object code for a
disk initialization routine. Any raw or blown disk may be formatted
by this routine to an empty disk with the soft-sector information
necessary for your controller. Note that CLEAR must be run after
formatting to use the disk with 86-DOS. The program prints a warning
message and asks which drive to format before initializing begins.

An important note about RDCPM and INIT:

These two programs bypass the operating system and either use the I/O
system (in the case of RDCPM) or talk directly to the disk controller
(in the case of INIT) to access the disk.  Therefore, if the I/O system
is changed so that the number and arrangment of drives is different,
RDCPM and INIT may have to be changed so that they respect the new
drive configuration.  The disk selections in INIT.ASM are very similar
to those in DOSIO.ASM, so if you change one, make appropriate changes
in the other.  Since INIT moves the disk drive heads around without the
knowledge of the I/O system, after initializing disks the heads will
probably be on a different track than the I/O system thinks they should
be on.  This usually results in a long delay in accessing any drive
used after a disk has been initialized on it because the I/O system
must decide it doesn't know where the head is, restore it to track
zero, and put it back where it's supposed to be.
