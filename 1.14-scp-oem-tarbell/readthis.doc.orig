                          Addendum for 86-DOS 1.1

This disk contains 86-DOS version 1.1 which is necessary to run the Microsoft
high-level language compiler or MACRO-86 assembler which you have purchased.
It also contains the newer versions of the system utilities which go with
86-DOS 1.1.  Sometime in December SCP will begin distribution of an even later
version of 86-DOS which will be fully documented and include all the features
of Microsoft's MS-DOS, IBM's Personal Computer DOS, and Lifeboat's SB-86.  The
later version will be available for a service charge (probably $25.00).

Differences between 86-DOS version 1.0 and 86-DOS version 1.1 (included on this
disk),  which the user must know about in order to use the new software:

	* 86-DOS no longer fits on the space reserved at the beginning of the
	  disk.  86-DOS resides in an invisible file which is always the first
	  file on the disk.  The boot sequence is now as follows:

	  1> the boot ROM loads the first sector from the disk and jumps to the
	     code loaded from that sector.
	  2> the code from the first sector loads in the I/O system which
	     follows the first sector in the reserved area and is typically
	     eight 128-byte sectors in length.  A jump is made to the
	     initialization program in the I/O system.
	  3> the initialization program in the I/O system uses the disk read
	     function of the I/O system to load 86-DOS from the invisible file.
	  4> the initialization code then uses 86-DOS to load in the command
	     interpreter, COMMAND.COM, from the disk and then jumps to it.

	* The SYS utility which copys 86-DOS from one disk to another also
	  copies the invisible file, 86DOS.SYS, which contains 86-DOS.  Because
	  this file must be the first file on the disk (so the I/O system can
	  find it when 86-DOS is booted up), SYS can only transfer the
	  operating system to a disk which is freshly CLEARed or already has a
	  file (invisible or not) called 86DOS.SYS which is large enough to
	  hold 86-DOS.

	* The CHKDSK utility prints the total number of files on the disk
	  including invisible files.  This allows the user to check for the
	  presence of invisible files such as 86DOS.SYS since the total number
	  of files reported by CHKDSK will be greater that that reported by the
	  DIR command.  Note:  be sure to use this new version of CHKDSK with
	  86-DOS version 1.1 because old versions of CHKDSK run under 86-DOS
	  version 1.1 can't "see" the invisible files and will free the disk
	  space allocated to these files thus destroying them.

	* The COMMAND interpreter (COMMAND.COM) can now load executable machine
	  language files with the extension .EXE (for EXEcute).  These are
	  similar to .COM files but have a 512-byte preface which contains
	  information on how to patch inter-segment jumps and calls within the 
	  file allowing multiple-segment files to be loaded.

	* DEBUG also can load .EXE files so that they can be debugged.

	* The assembler has had some rather significant features added to it.

	  The expression analyser can now perform multiplication and division
	  as well as addition and subtraction.  Use "*" to multiply and "/" to
	  divide.  Multiplications and divisions are performed before additions
	  and subtractions.  Parentheses may be used to change this normal
	  order of precedence.

	  Errors messages are sent directly to the console as well as put in
	  the .PRN print file so that it is not necessary to make a print file
	  to find out what errors are in the source code.  Two more options
	  have been added to the third letter of the drive assignment
	  extention which tells the assembler what to do with the print file.

	  A-O send print file to disk drive A-O
	  P   send print file directly to printer (tabs are NOT expanded)
	  X   send print file to console
	  Y   force a second pass through the source file so that error
	      messages sent to the console include the text of the source file
	      line on which the error occured
	  Z   no print file.  Error messages sent to the console will indicate
	      what error occured and on which line, but will not include the
	      text of the line in which the error occured

	  The Z option is normally only used if you are assembling a file which
	  probably has no errors in it (perhaps you've assembled it before and
	  know it has no errors), so that incomplete error messages are of no
	  consequence.  Using the Z option results in faster assembly since the
	  assembler doesn't have to make a second pass through source file.

	  Line numbers have been added to the print file to make it easier to
	  find particular lines using the editor.

	  The assembler now handles 8087 opcodes.  Complete documentation on
	  this feature will be provided with the new release in December.

	* The disk initialization program (INIT.COM) has been changed so that
	  the drive letters and disk formats correspond to those used by the
	  operating system.  For example, with the Tarbell double-density
	  controller there are no longer two different initialization programs
	  INIT and DINIT for single and double-density disks.  The new INIT
	  will format a double-density double-sided disk in drives E or F if
	  if you have double-sided drives.  See the warning about changing
	  DOSIO and INIT in the file NEWS.DOC.
