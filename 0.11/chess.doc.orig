This chess game uses algebraic chess notation. The files are lettered
"a" to "h" and the ranks are numbered 1 to 8. The lower left-hand corner
(from White's viewpoint) is a1.

Moves are entered as ff-tt (f=from, t=to), so to play the white king's
pawn up two squares you would enter E2-E4. You must enter your file
letters in upper case, while the computer will always use lower case.

To castle, enter only the king's move. The computer castles the same way.
To capture En Passant, enter your pawn's actual move.

Ply depth is the number of half-turns the computer looks ahead. For
example, with a ply depth of 3, the computer will consider
	1. All of his possible moves
	2. All of your responses to those moves.
	3. All of his possible replies to your responses.
Start at ply depth 2 to get the feel for it.

A move of "R" will restart the game.
